Our website is a forum about pets. Home section will show the hot posts, which are posts with a lot of discussions. For the forum part, we use a 2-level navigation bar. The first level is about functionality and the second level is about kinds of animals. We make a faked log in since we are only making the front end. You can try it with username "user" and password "pass". After you log in, the login button will be replaced by "my account" button, which shows the detail of your account. In project phase 3, we will allow user to edit their account (i.e., change passwords, email address.). And user will be able to read and make posts.
